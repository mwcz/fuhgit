File Upstream History - git

A plugin for seeing a git file history in vim. Based on Ben Cotterell's git-time-lapse plugin (https://github.com/johntyree/time-lapse.vim) and similar to :Glog functionality in Tim Pope's fugitive plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).
I'm hoping to improve upon the git-time-lapse plugin in several ways:
 * Make it compatible with Tim Pope's pathogen plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
 * Allow the user to see the changes over a range of commits instead of a single commit at a time.
 * Maintain the cursor position while scrolling through commits.
 * Include an option for a single pane view which is more similar to the fugitive :Glog functionality but with highlighting and indexing of changed lines.
 * Have an official Github repository so that it's more public than the git-time-lapse semi-private repo. (linked to from vim.org)
